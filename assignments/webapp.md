For this assignment, you will create a mobile web application that works well on desktop, tablets, and smartphones. The design and function of the application is up to you: you will choose the topic and functionality of your app, as well as the framework and platform that run the application. Your app should read and write to a database and make use of common HTTP requests through an API. In addition to your app, you should compose a 750-word short paper that describes your thoughts and experiences regarding the development process of working with a web application framework as opposed to hand-coding a site or using a CMS. In this document you should make sure to cite specific examples from all sites youâ€™ve made previously; the bulk of the points for this paper will come from your examples and descriptions of why one approach was different than another.

Your grade for this assignment will be based upon the following criteria:

|
-|---
10%|Responsiveness to Assignment
20%|Quality & Correctness of Code
20%|Technical Implementation (server install, database, domain location)
20%|Adherence to Design Principles
30%|Short Paper

Use your web server space to host your app and send me the link for the app you want me to grade (or post the link to the Sakai assignment). You should also zip and submit the code for the frontend app to Sakai, and send the link to your Github repository that contains the backend app code. I will view the app on desktop, tablet, and smartphone. Upload your short paper directly to Sakai as a PDF. I will grade whatever is available at the link you send me, but I will not accept multiple emails from you. This is worth getting right the first time!
