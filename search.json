    "section": "",
    "text": "These tips are adapted from Dr. Fee’s website and are intended as important general guidelines for the class.\nThrough years of observing student performance at W&J, there are a number of practices that seem relatively common as areas of concern. So, in an effort to provide you with warnings or advice that will help you make the most of your work as a student in digital media courses, I present you with the following list:\n\nRead. I wouldn’t assign texts for these courses if they weren’t important. This goes for project descriptions sheets, handouts, the syllabus, etc. If I’m asking you to read it, it is critical that you understand the content. I am going to assume that you do.\nDon’t wait until the last minute. Web development is a field of production—at the end of the day, there is something to show for our work. This means you can’t fake it. You can’t really throw it all together at the end, near the deadline. The work tells. It will be obvious if you don’t put the time, attention, or effort into your work.\nShow your work to others. Increasingly, we are all working more independently. However, there is something that gets lost in that: feedback from others. Work together in groups and benefit from the input of others. Even if it is an independent project, get feedback from other viewers so you can see the different decodings that take place. It will make your work stronger.\nUse the lab. This tip also makes it easier to get opinions form others. Even if you are working independently, it provides access to feedback from other students that may have already completed the same course. It also provides a work space that is free from multiple distractions and can help you focus on your work.\nRecognize that you don’t multitask nearly as well as you think you do. This is something that we are all guilty of, and in fact, we even have cognitive science research that indicates we are bad at it in general. So, recognize that a lack of focus reduces the overall effectiveness of your work. We all have a lot to get done: focus, pay attention to details, and get the work completed.\nStudy and practice. There truly is no substitute for this. Regardless of the content made available to you as a student, the real learning will only take place if you review the course materials, and practice regularly the skills you’ve been shown or pointed toward. As with any endeavor—if you want to become good at it, you’ve got to practice.\n\nI am often asked by students what they can do to improve their grade, or to do better in a course. More often than not, simply adhering to the tips above would address this issue."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Complete by: Thursday 13 Feb. at class time\nFor this assignment, you need to create a personal web site that adheres to responsive web design and works well on a desktop, tablet, and smartphone. To meet the requirements of the assignment you need to create a home page with links out to additional pages, information, and/or media. Your site should contain a legitimate amount of content and information to express your ideas. In addition, you should compose a 500-word short paper that explains your thoughts behind your design decisions, with specific examples to the site you’ve made and references to some of our course resources.\nYour website should also include an interactive element using JavaScript. What exactly this entails is up to you, but your site should take some user input (e.g. entering information in a text box or clicking a button) and produce a visible change to the webpage. A description of the choices you made in devising this interactivity should be part of your short paper.\nIf you completed a similar website for CIS 275 or another course, you may use that as a starting point for this assignment. But you should add a significant amount of new content and design elements to your site, and your essay should outline the differences between the original project and the new one.\nSources for your reconsideration regarding design issues include our discussions on basic design principles and the Web Style Guide (3rd ed.). You should also review the ancillary links provided on the additional resources page of our course site.\nTo excel in the assignment, you should closely adhere to the design principles we have studied, and you should also be extremely careful with your coding syntax.\nYour grade for this assignment will be based upon the following criteria:\n\n\n\n10%\nResponsiveness to Assignment\n\n\n30%\nQuality & Correctness of Code\n\n\n20%\nAdherence to Responsive Web Design Principles\n\n\n20%\nSuccessfully Implemented Interactivity\n\n\n20%\nShort Paper\n\n\n\nMarkup for this project must adhere to HTML5 & CSS3 specifications, and code should adhere to JavaScript ES6. You should use a text editor to create your html, cs, and js files. Zip all these files up into one archive file and submit it to Sakai by the beginning of class on the due date."

    "text": "Each class must create its own learning community as the result of shared efforts on the part of all members. It is your responsibility as a member of this learning community to help your fellow students by attending class and turning in assignments on time. If you must miss a class or turn in an assignment late, please let me know beforehand so that we may work out a way for you to make up the work. You do not need a doctor’s note or other written excuse, but please let me know if there are special circumstances that may prevent you from completing a large amount of coursework.\nI won’t bother to give you information unless you actually need to know it. In return, I ask that you actually read it, and make your best effort to understand and remember the details.\nPlease note that you may not record or capture any classroom interactions through any means unless you seek permission of the instructor in advance. Pennsylvania is a dual consent state - you cannot record anyone else without their permission. This includes your classmates.\nTaking responsibility and ownership for your data will make your experiences in computing much less taxing! Make sure you have backup copies of all your work on a flash drive or a cloud storage service.\n\n\n\n\nGood participation should be understood as consistent and thoughtful contribution to the classroom community, an engagement with course materials and conversations, and a general responsiveness to (and respect for) one’s fellow students and instructor. This isn’t an accounting of how often you speak in class. Instead, it’s about what you offer to the intellectual life of the class, and everyone contributes to this on-going work in different ways.\nAttending class is not optional: regular attendance is necessary to succeed in this course. Each day will have new content, activities, and learning opportunities. You’ll want to attend as much as possible to avoid falling behind. If you have to miss class for any reason, please let me know in advance, especially if you have to miss more than one class in a row. Missing class is not an excuse for missing assignment deadlines, being unprepared for the next class session, or falling behind on the weekly workshops. You are responsible for keeping up-to-date with the work of the course or for communicating with me about unexpected circumstances which change your ability to do so. We’re all in this together, and I’ll do my best to make sure no one falls behind.\n\n\n\nAll assignments are due by the time listed on the prompt. I know that things don’t always go according to plan. If you need an extension, simply ask for one (using the web form), and you’ll almost always receive it. You don’t need an excuse to receive an extension!\nHowever, you must ask for the extension at least 24 hours before the assignment deadline. To request an extension, simply fill out this form, where you will propose a new deadline for the assignment (a good rule of thumb is a day or two after the original deadline). Any work received late (less than 48 hours) without an agreed-upon extension will receive a point deduction.\nBut keep in mind: I cannot accept any assignment more than 48 hours late. Assignments more than 48 hours late will receive a 0.\n\n\nIf I have to miss class due to illness or any other reason, I will let you know as soon as possible via email. I’ll also post any relevant materials on Sakai or on this website, and my email will let you know what you need to do. It’s a good idea to check your email at least once a day, since that’s the primary way I’ll keep in touch about any changes to the schedule.\n\n\n\n\nIn this course, as in all courses, you are expected to adhere to W&J’s standards of academic honesty and integrity. You should refer to the College Catalog on MyW&J for the details of this policy and how cases of academic misconduct are handled.\nIn general, when completing writing assignments, ensure all work is your own, and give credit where it is due in your citations. Likewise do not collaborate on tests, or homework assignments unless explicitly granted permission. If you have any concerns about whether you might have plagiarized (e.g., if you’re not sure about some particular rule), please get in touch with me immediately—I will gladly discuss the matter with you.\n\n\nThese standards of academic integrity apply to coding as well as other kinds of classwork. Citation isn’t just for papers! It’s very common, and perfectly permissible, to borrow code snippets from a classmate or from somewhere online. When you do, make sure to include a note in your code’s comments about where the code came from. Keep in mind that this includes the use of any automated writing or code assistants like ChatGPT—any use of such programs should be cited like any website, with a link to the chat record. Not only will this let you give appropriate intellectual credit and avoid plagiarism, it will also help you remember what you were trying to do when you revise your code later.\nWith regard to ChatGPT, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, or any related generative AI systems, keep in mind that in this class you are only permitted to use these systems to help with your code, never with your writing. If you do use a code assistant to help, you must cite what you used in a comment and include a link to the chat record. Otherwise, your use of chatbots will be considered academic misconduct. And keep in mind that these tools may not give you the best advice! It’s always better to work from our course materials or ask a classmate for help.\n\n\n\n\nEveryone has the right to be addressed as they feel most comfortable. It’s hard to learn if you cringe every time I call on you or address you in communication. I will ask everyone at the beginning of the semester to tell me their preferred name, pronunciation, and the pronouns they use. I will do my very best to get it right. Please do not feel the need to change your name or pronouns to “make it easy” for me, and please correct me if I get it wrong! This policy goes for everyone—use the names and pronouns dictated by the person to whom they belong. Also, our personal growth does not always align with the semester system: If your name or pronoun changes part way through the class, please send me an update!\n\n\n\nPlease be respectful with your use of computers and technology in class. I request that you only use them for class related purposes, as I and others may find them distracting (For example, no email or social media should be open in your browser tabs!). Cell phones should be kept silent and put away, and you can expect the same from me.\n\n\n\nI encourage you to email me anytime with questions or thoughts about the class. It can sometimes take me up to 24 hours to respond to your message, but I will do my best to get back to you within that period. On the weekends (Friday 5pm–Monday 9am), the response time is 48 hours. This means that if you have a question about an assignment that you email to me the night before something is due, I may not be able to get back to you until after the assignment was due. In these cases, it’s best to plan ahead. But don’t hesitate to email whenever you have a question, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can!"

    "text": "Important Resources for this Class and Your College Journey\n\nCIS PAL Tutors\nThe CIS department has its own PAL tutors: they’re available to help Sunday–Thursday evenings from 7–10pm in the CIS Lounge on the second floor of the Tech Center. (I’ll post more detailed tutor bios and schedules on Sakai.)\n\n\nMental Health\nWhat we do in college is not easy, on many fronts. Students are challenged with feelings of depression, anxiety, and self harm at astonishingly high rates. Learning is hard, and you will likely be challenged in college in ways that you haven’t experienced before. Learning while life is hard is even harder. Please take care of yourself. Drink water, eat well, and get more than seven hours of sleep. Have some hobbies, but don’t feel the need to do everything. If you are feeling depressed, withdrawn, anxious, like an impostor, or you are having specific problems with harassment, assault, bias, etc., please seek help. There are many resources on campus, and my door and email are always open.\nW&J’s Student Health and Counseling Center offers confidential counseling services: https://www.washjeff.edu/student-life/student-health-and-counseling-center/\n\n\nDisability Support Services\nWashington & Jefferson College is committed to providing academic accommodations for students with disabilities. This includes individuals with physical disabilities, learning disabilities, and mental health disorders that meet the definition of a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students who plan to request accommodations should contact the Director for Academic Success as early as possible, although requests may be made at any time. To determine whether you qualify for accommodations, or if you have questions about services and procedures, please call 724-223-6008 or send an email to dss@washjeff.edu.\n\n\nW&J Library\nI highly recommend that you make use of the W&J Library resources while navigating your work this semester. That includes not only primary literature, access to databases, and book references, but also the friendly members of the library staff. They are excellent resources for finding information efficiently, or learning what you can access through W&J subscriptions that might not be freely available on the internet. The W&J Library page for CIS is https://libguides.washjeff.edu/cis.\n\n\nWriting Center\nStaffed by student Peer Writing Tutors, the Writing Center is a free resource available to all W&J students. Writing Tutors from many majors help writers one-on-one in all phases of the writing process, from deciphering assignments, to discussing ideas, to developing an argument, to finalizing a draft. Because proofreading is a last step in that process, you should leave plenty of time (like at least a week) for getting your ideas right before expecting proofreading help. Consultants also can help writers with personal documents, like job and internship applications. The Center welcomes student writers with all varieties of backgrounds and college preparation, including multilingual writers. Please visit the Writing Center’s page (https://mywj.washjeff.edu/office/writing-center) on MyW&J for specific information regarding hours of availability and how to schedule an appointment.\n\n\nCautions regarding copyright and licensing\nAll documents provided to you (i.e. syllabus, paper prompts, tests, etc…) are the property of the instructor or author. It is a violation of intellectual property to post these online (especially to websites promoting copying/cheating) or to provide them to students not in our class or in future classes. Your papers are your property, and while you can do with them as you wish, it may be a violation of academic integrity to make them available to others who might use them for plagiarism. Basically, keep course materials and your work to yourself except in the process of editing and peer review.\n\n\nInclusion and Diversity\nThis course is open to anyone interested in web design and development. It is my intent to make all students feel welcome and served in this course by addressing their learning needs. In this course, if you encounter anything said (intentionally or unintentionally) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. If your learning is impacted by your background, or any life event going on outside of class, feel free to talk to me. Even if you choose not to share details, I would be happy to direct you to the right resources on campus. I look forward to creating a safe learning environment together this semester!"
